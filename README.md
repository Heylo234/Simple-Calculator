# Simple-Calculator
A simple Calculator I decided I wanted to make.
# How-To-Use
To do the following you will have to create a virtual environment. To do this, I recommend Pycharms as all projects start with one preinstalled but other softwares such as VScode and Sublime Text can work but need some preperations.

Step 1:
Open the file in a Code reader (VS code for example) then copy it ( or run it in the reader itself) over to a Python running software (Python 3.10 or Pycharms) and run it in there.

Step 2:
Once it is running, it will ask you whether you want to add, subtract, multiply or divide. Type the word all lowercase and with no space. Then it will ask you for a number. Type a number in (No decimals as of yet). After that a second number then it should give you an answer.
