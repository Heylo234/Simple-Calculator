A simple Calculator I decided I wanted to make.
# How-To-Use
Step 1:
Open the file in a Code reader (VS code for example) then copy it ( or run it in the reader itself) over to a Python running software (Python 3.10 or Pycharms) and run it in there.
Step 2:
Once it is running, it will ask you whether you want to add, subtract, multiply or divide. Type the word all lowercase and with no space. Then it will ask you for a number. Type a number in (No decimals as of yet). After that a second number then it should give you an answer.
